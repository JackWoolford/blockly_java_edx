 <h1>Sequence of instructions</h1>
 
<p>Welcome to your first blockly exercise. In this, you will learn how instructions work in Java and what effect do they have when they are put one after another. In this exercise (and many more during this course) we are going to use the graphical programming that you see just below this text. To use it, simply drag and drop blocks of code from the left side toolbar into the workspace. You will see how the code is generated as you drop the code blocks into the workspace. When you are done, press the "Compile" button. This will transform your blocks into computer-ready code to be executed by your computer. If there are no errors, the next button, "Execute" will be enabled. Press that button to execute the compiled code and show the result in the down right side of the workspace. </p>


 
<p>Easy, right? Let's get started! You'll see how easy and fun is computer programming with Java.</p>

<p>In our first examples we are going to learn to execute sequences of instructions. Computers are machines that are prepared to execute very simple instructions such as summs, multiplicatons and other simple mathematical and logical operations. As you have already notice, the program you use every day are by far much more complex that those simple sums we just described. This is because a computer program is composed by thousands or millions of those more simple lines of code. For instance, the Android Operating System is more than a million lines of code long. Don't worry by these numbers, we will start working on small projects with a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Below this text you will find a box divided in three sections. On the left bar side, you will find a list of blocks. At the moment we have only one block, that says 'set variable to 0'. LetÂ´s see what happens when we drop this block into the white workspace zone. Try now to drag the 'set variable to 0' to the workspace zone.</p>
